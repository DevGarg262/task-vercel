# MyWays Task

I have completed the frontened work, i have made the main homepage with signup and login modals in the given time frame.Other otp and success model is also same as signup model. I Yesterday Evening i got the task and i have to submit it todays's evening. I haven't use any other resource i wrote whole code myself and css adjustments are also causing issues according to the given dimensions.

I haven't done the backend auth work because that work is very lengthy and requires a committed time period but i have done this login signup and forgot password thing in my previous projects. I wrote the apis for them and also used Google Auth for Authorization.I'm attaching the link of one of the auth file which i made in one of my project food app and it include all the things that you are asking me to write.
